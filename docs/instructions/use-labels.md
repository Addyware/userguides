# How to Use Labels and Filters in Trello  

## Overview  
Labels and filters in Trello help you **categorize tasks**, **prioritize work**, and **quickly find specific cards**. Labels add **color-coded tags** to cards, while filters allow you to view only the tasks that match specific criteria.

!!! note "Why Use Labels?"
    
    Labels make it easier to identify **task priorities** at a glance.  
    Example:  
    ðŸ”´ RED â†’ Urgent  
    ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW â†’ In Progress  
    ðŸŸ¢ GREEN â†’ Completed
